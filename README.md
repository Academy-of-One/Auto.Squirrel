#### This utility is useful to create installer based on **[Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows)**.

The main purpose is to fully automatize the application deploy , from build to upload  the updated files.

With a single mouse click you can :

1. **Update Application Version** the package version is extracted from exe file , you don't need to set this value manually

2. **Create Squirrel Package** . In similar way you do with Nuget Package Manager, just drag the file you want into window.

3. **Upload installer files** . Set connection details one time .

4. **Decide to upload only the updated files or do complete setup upload**
